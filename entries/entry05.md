# Entry 5: The Current Final Product
##### 4/23/23

I believe we began this journey in the late days of October, and my first Blog Entry was in the early days of November. 
Since then, I have made a lot of progress in my product, being able to finish a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that I can showcase to others.
This Blog Entry is for going over the MVP I created, using new knowledge and tricks I used to create it, explaining how I was able to finish on time.

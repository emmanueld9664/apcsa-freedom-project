# Entry 1: Defining & Researching My Project.
##### 11/9/2022

It has been more than 2 weeks since we have come up with the main idea of our project and the Tool that we will use to create it. 
In some ways, my project is an evolution on my previous project, which was a simple boss fight simulation. 
This year, however, I plan to make a more grand adventure for the player to embark on. Give them more freedom, a more unique gameplay loop, a story, and a unique theme. 
I chose this as my project because I still have a passion for videogames, despite how I've deviated from playing them, and I love the idea of creating my own videogames and worlds someday.
The whole project will be based off of another videogame, movie, show, or book. More akin to a fan project, where I make a game based off of the aspects of those stories for the player to enjoy. 
In terms of what I've decided to base my game off of, I'm not entirely sure, but I do have a few choices:

- Bloodborne; Striking lore, interesting mechanics in Rally and Trick Weapons, and a beautiful local.
- Demon Slayer; My personal favorite, great gameplay variety with Breathing Techniques, unique art style, and historically pleasant to think about.
- JoJo's Bizarre Adventure; Choosing a "Part" would be difficult, but with how bizarre everything is, it would definitely be a unique experience regardless of chosen Part.

As for how I will make this game, I intend to use Unity, which I recently learned can make 2d games, just the type I'm planning to make for mine. Over the past 2 or so weeks, I have been using a guide about [How to Create an RPG Game in Unity](https://gamedevacademy.org/how-to-create-an-rpg-game-in-unity-comprehensive-guide/).
This guide has been extremely helpful to me, as it gave me insight about Unity's unique mechanics when it comes to making games. 
Some things are similar to what I learned in p5js, such as a canvas. Though less of coding, and more of inputting values, creating a canvas is still very similar.
I did a weeks worth of research on another game development system, called [Game Maker Studio](https://gamemaker.io/en/gamemaker), which had been used to create the biggest hit of 2015, Undertale. 
The reason I didn't choose Game Maker Studio was due to the fact that Unity seemed to have more support and articles made about how to use it. Which went more in-depth for what I could find for Game Maker Studio.

I am currently within the first two stages of the Engineering Design Process, defining and researching my project.
Right now, I am simply defining the outline of what I want my project to be, more unique gameplay, story, and a better theme.
As for research, I looked for what I could base my game off of, and what tools I could use to create this game.
Currently, I am bettering in two skills, how to learn, and consideration. With how to learn, I have taken the time to learn new tools, like Unity. Which I had never used beforehand, and even learn a little bit of Game Maker Studio through videos. 
While for consideration, I find myself being able to consider between different options on what my project should be. 
Previously I even asked my class to help me decide between one large story, or a multi-short story game. 
Next time, I will be Brainstorming and Planning out my project in more detail, and will likely have come up with a real decision for what my game should be.

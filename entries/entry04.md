# Entry 4
##### 3/19/23

Since my last Blog Entry, I have finished the Test file I wished to work on following.
However, because of many personal issues concerning mental health and other issues, I haven't been able to work much towards my MVP.
I've made some progress, but it's mainly surface level, and any larger progress will have to be pushed over the following month.
Thus, in this Blog Entry, I would like to explore some progress made in my Test file of Unity.

I would like to explore some very interesting and important content, specifically Switching Scenes, with Camera and Map Manipulation.
Switching Scenes is integral for any multi-layered game. Switching Scenes includes entering new locations, entering combat, even small things like UI updates are done through scene switching.
It's a broad concept, that allows for almost any 2D Unity game to function.
The other concepts of Camera and Map Manipulation fall into a similar category under Scene Switching.
By manipulating the camera, we can follow the player character for better interaction, better movement, etc.
Through manipulating our maps, we can easier access other scenes and areas that players should be allowed to go to under the specific circumstances.

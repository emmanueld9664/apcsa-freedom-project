# Entry 4
##### 3/19/23

Since my last Blog Entry, I have made many impressive and wonderful leaps and breakthroughs concerning my newfound knowledge in Unity and Game Development.
Previously, I had began a second trial of my learning, taking into consideration how I hadn't felt I had learned enough and starting over. 
Since then, I have made an entire plan that has helped me improve my time management, while also giving me an improved way to complete the steps I wish to complete in a better manner. 
For around the first two weeks following my last Blog Entry, I continued to work on my Test Unity file, where I followed the Udemy Course in-depth.
I finished it around the 3rd of March, and have worked extensively on my real project since then. I've made some progress, though some events have come in the way of such as well.

In this Blog Entry, however, I would like to go over the more complete version of my Test file. 
It shares most of the things I have learned since starting it, so it would be much like showing you a current version of my actual game I hope.
Today, I wish to share my developments on switching scenes, including camera manipulation and mapping for the world that I have learned.
Switching scenes is a process of sudden shifts between two different areas. For example, when leaving a dungeon in an RPG, you're switching scenes in that case.
Camera Movement is self explanatory, as it is what allows the player to follow their character as they move about in a 2d or 3d space. 
The following section goes over the topic of scene transitioning, a large player in any game.

# Entry 4
##### 3/19/23

Since my last Blog Entry, I have finished the Test file I wished to work on following.
However, because of many personal issues concerning mental health and other issues, I haven't been able to work much towards my MVP.
I've made some progress, but it's mainly surface level, and any larger progress will have to be pushed over the following month.
Thus, in this Blog Entry, I would like to explore some progress made in my Test file of Unity.

I would like to explore some very interesting and important content, specifically Switching Scenes, with Map Manipulation.
Switching Scenes is integral for any multi-layered game. Switching Scenes includes entering new locations, entering combat, even small things like UI updates are done through scene switching.
It's a broad concept, that allows for almost any 2D Unity game to function.
Man Manipulation sort of falls into a subcategory of Scene Switching, due to the fact that in order to switch scenes, you need to have an available map open to switch into.
This being able to manipulate and pull specific maps for when they are needed is a big help.

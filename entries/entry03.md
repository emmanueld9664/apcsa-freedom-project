# Entry 3: Creating & Testing a Prototype
##### 2/12/23

Since my previous Blog Entry, I have taken a few steps back in terms of the ambitious project I have taken into my hands. 
Previously, I wanted to work on my in-game sprites, while under the impression that I had done enough in my game to warrent them.
After a serious analysis of where I actually was in my process, I decided my best course of action would be to have a soft reset of sorts.
I decided to follow my previously introduced [Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/unity2drpg/) more in-depth, and step by step. There were many things I missed, and many that I needed to improve on.
Thus, while going through it again, I created a better prototype of my project with the given assets and wish to share my new, refreshed, knowledge and achievements with you now.

My first step in this soft-reset would be to restart my background and movement section. Which, over a few days, I finished. The background was simple, I only needed to pull the image into the Scene where the camera lied. 
Next would be to give the image it's own specific layer, which was called the Background Layer. That way, the image would not conflict with any other objects on the screen.
Here is a [screenshot](screenshot.png.png) of the described action.

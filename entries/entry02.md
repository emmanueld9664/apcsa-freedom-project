# Entry 2: Brainstorming For & Planning the Future.
##### 12/18/22

Since my last blog entry, I have spent a while doing both more research and more development on my Freedom Project. 
As stated before, I am using Unity to develop my game, and I have decided through a class vote that my main focus will be basing my game off of Demon Slayer. 
With this focus, I was able to better learn Unity with a clear goal in what I want my game to end up as.
Throughout the past month and some change, I have been setting up and working on Unity in order to learn more about it and it's quirks. 
When starting this project, I searched for a few courses, and found one that helped me a lot. 
This course, [Learn to Create An RPG Game in Unity](https://www.udemy.com/course/unity2drpg/), allowed me to have a well-explained and quick way to go through learning Unity.
The course gave me enough resources to quickly create a small example game, which has allowed me to learn more about how the Player should move, or how to switch scenes or maps in succession.
With this, I also have to start planning for the future. 
My first idea is to start learning spirte work. This is because I want to make unique sprites for my game, and while definitely choppy, I intend to use them to make unique visuals in my own style.
I have found a few resources concerning this area, the best one so far has been this [Pixel Art Tutorial](https://www.derekyu.com/makegames/pixelart.html).
That is mainly what I am planning for Winter Break, and hopefully afterwards I will have at least 1 character spritesheet and one or two map sheets.

Currently, I am on the third and fourth stages of the Engineering Design Process, Brainstorming and Planning for the future of my project.
I thought of where I was currently at in my research of Unity and game design, and have now planned for a way to move forward in the coming weeks.
With that, I know that I am getting better in two skills now, problem decomposition and organization. 
In terms of the latter, I have become better in organizing my time. Seeing what I should learn and in what order, so that I could best optimize the development of my game.
The former skill is improving because I have broken down where I should continue next, put most of my focus in and set as a priority for my project.
On my next blog entry, I will have created a prototype of my project, and I will be testing it to see its flaws and strengths, and thus see where to go from there.
Until next time, Arrivederci.

# Entry 2: Brainstorming For & Planning the Future.
##### 12/18/22

Since my last blog entry, I have spent a while doing both more research and more development on my Freedom Project. 
As stated before, I am using Unity to develop my game, and I have decided through a class vote that my main focus will be basing my game on Demon Slayer. 
With this focus, I was able to better learn Unity with a clear goal in what I want my game to end up as. 
Throughout the past month and some changes, I have been setting up and working on Unity to learn more about it and its quirks. 
When starting this project, I searched for a few courses and found one that helped me a lot. 
This course, [Learn to Create An RPG Game in Unity](https://www.udemy.com/course/unity2drpg/), allowed me to have a well-explained and quick way to go through learning Unity. 
The course gave me enough resources to quickly create a small example game, which has allowed me to learn more about how the Player should move, or how to switch scenes or maps in succession. 
With this, I also have to start planning for the future. My first idea is to start learning sprite work. 
This is because I want to make unique sprites for my game, and while choppy, I intend to use them to make unique visuals in my style. 
I have found a few resources concerning this area, the best one so far has been this [Pixel Art Tutorial](https://www.derekyu.com/makegames/pixelart.html).
That is mainly what I am planning for Winter Break, and hopefully, afterward, I will have at least 1 character sprite sheet and one or two map sheets.

Currently, I am in the third and fourth stages of the Engineering Design Process, Brainstorming, and Planning for the future of my project. 
I thought of where I was currently at in my research of Unity and game design, and have now planned for a way to move forward in the coming weeks. 
With that, I know that I am getting better at two skills now, problem decomposition and organization. 
In terms of the latter, I have become better at organizing my time. 
Seeing what I should learn and in what order so that I could best optimize the development of my game. 
The former skill is improving because I have broken down where I should continue next, put most of my focus on, and set it as a priority for my project. 
In my next blog entry, I will have created a prototype of my project, and I will be testing it to see its flaws and strengths, and thus see where to go from there. 
Until next time, Arrivederci.

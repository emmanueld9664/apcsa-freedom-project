# Entry 2: Brainstorming For & Planning the Future.
##### 12/18/22

Since my last blog entry, I have spent a while doing both more research and more development on my Freedom Project. 
As stated before, I am using Unity to develop my game, and I have decided through a class vote that my main focus will be basing my game off of Demon Slayer. 
With this focus, I was able to better learn Unity with a clear goal in what I want my game to end up as.
Throughout the past month and some change, I have been setting up and working on Unity in order to learn more about it and it's quirks. 
When starting this project, I searched for a few courses, and found one that helped me a lot. 
This course, [Learn to Create An RPG Game in Unity](https://www.udemy.com/course/unity2drpg/), allowed me to have a well-explained and quick way to go through learning Unity.
The course gave me enough resources to quickly create a small example game, which has allowed me to learn more about how the Player should move, or how switch scenes or maps in succession.
With this, I also have to start planning for the future. 
My first idea is to start learning spirte work. This is because I want to make unique sprites for my game, and while definitely choppy, I intend to use them to make unique visuals in my own style.
I have found a few resources concerning this area, the best one so far has been this [Pixel Art Tutorial](https://www.derekyu.com/makegames/pixelart.html).
That is mainly what I am planning for Winter Break, and hopefully afterwards I will have at least 1 character spritesheet and one or two map sheets.

# Entry 6: The Aftermath
##### 5/31/2023

It has been an entire school year now, since October, that I have been working on my Freedom Project. Which I have only recently called Z-Game, and the process has been incredibly unique. 
The course of developing this project has been one that has taught me a lot about game development going forward. 
Not only was development an experience, but so was presenting and showcasing my product to others as well. 
For this Blog Entry, I would be very interested in showing you the takeaways from both events, which have been instrumental in shaping my process of work going forward.

### In Class Presentation
In class, each student or group had to present their project in slides, to the entire class. 
I saw some really impressive ones, that used more interesting programs compared to my own.
In all honesty, I did not feel like I had prepared enough when I presented.
There was a lot before my presentation that stopped me from making the best of it.
However, I still had to present relatively early on, compared to my peers. 
Thus, I took the opportunity to push myself to present the best I could have, with what I was given.
With a pep in my step, I went forward to give the presentation of my game.

To be honest, I think I did fairly well presenting my game. 
Sometimes, I would stutter from moment to moment, but I presented it with as clear a voice as I could.
I really showed my passion for my project, something that I always want to show in any project I do. 
I represented what I learned in an honest, clear and concise way that I believe helped my peers really understand what I wanted to create.
Even concerning my shortcomings, I wanted to convey a sense of learning, growth, experience and difficulties when I made my game.
I can perfectly remember when I was describing collision, and then accidentally stepped over one of the trash cans near the board. 
It was really funny, and it probably added to the humor I always try to add to my presentations.
Concerning my final slides, I made sure to improvise my takeaways while showcasing a demo of my game to the class.
I had to work quick on my feet for it, and I think it paid off well.

Overall, I had a really good experience presenting, even if I didn't think I had enough to present.
It was enough of a good experience, that I have some overall presentation takeaways from presenting.

- Improvise! At least concerning myself, it is okay to not have a presentation that has everything. A presentation is a basic showcase of what you want to show, when you actually present, you can add on and talk about everything with more depth. I did this when I didn't include my takeaways, and also to describe my own code better, because it's easier to speak than to show.
- Make people laugh, it simply adds a lot to the experience. Presenting can get a bit boring if there isn't something interesting, so try to make a joke here or there, especially in your slides, that can help lighten the mood and keep your viewers attention.
- Be honest. Don't pretend you didn't have difficulties at any point. It is completely fine, and even motivational, to say that you had difficulties at times. That you may have not managed your time well, or that you messed up somewhere and couldn't fix it in time.
A lot of respect goes to Kaan, who was open about having deleted his game accidentally, and having to remake it in two days. That's a quality that should be respected, and it is a great show of honesty.

### SEP Expo
The SEP Expo, dated May 24th, was another very interesting experience. 
It was one of the most busy events I'd ever been to, and with that, it was very exciting at the same time. 
Being able to chat with friends, while also being able to express my passion for my own project to others outside of my class was incredible.

Most of the people I interacted with I knew, they'd seen me and wished to look at my project. 
To which I responded with delight, I didn't exactly have an elevator pitch, so what I described came exactly from what I remembered and how I felt concerning my own project.
I knew what I wanted to convey when presenting, that I wanted my project to be a showcase of my passion for writing, game development, and giving people a reason to smile.
When the judges came, I was quite afraid. I felt like my body was too shaky, my voice was too squeaky, and my presentation should've been planned beforehand. 
Yet even still, I made sure to present the project I made, in the way I wanted to present it.
I gave my experience learning unity, C Sharp, my passion for making others happy, which was my reason for making the game, and my love for writing.
Not only did I want my presentation to be about what I made, but why I made it.

Overall, I think I did very well concerning the SEP Expo. I had fun, I showcased my own project, and I believe I did a good job with presentations.
I do have some takeaways, that I would like to share with you now. 

- Improvise, adapt, overcome. Much like before, presenting your project is a lot about improvisation. You can have ideas on what you want to say, but you should really say what's best concerning the current topic. When my video concerned collision, I began to talk about collision, when it reached interactions I talked about those. Be able to flow into these concepts and ideas easily.
- Be passionate. The most important detail and quality any person can have is being passionate about their work. You need to show that you love what you made, the passion that went into your project and more. In my personal opinion, your project should be a true representation of your passion, interests, and more. So you have to represent that the best you can in your presentation.

### Last Statement
This Blog Entry marks the end of not only my Freedom Project, but also a closing of the final chapter of my High School years.
This Blog finishes out the final step of the Engineering Design Process, communicating the results. I believe, after all this, I have done a wonderful job at communicating everything in the way that I felt I had to.
There are two skills that I have definitely improved on since these two presentations: Communication and Creativity.
- Communication. I believe this is self-explanatory, for both events, I was able to communicate most of what went into my project, the passion, the effort, and more. My communication skills concerning my project have been immaculate, and have only grown because I do love my project beyond what I expected. 
- Creativity. While my project may not be the most creative, it is my own desire for helping others, making others smile, that enhances the quality of my project immensely. Creativity is a large part of my project, and as such, I'm glad it was the final skill I improved when working on it.

For now, that is all. I am extremely glad that I spent the time to make this project. It has been an experience I will never forget.
The largest thanks goes to my best friend, Jan. With even more thanks given out to everyone taking the APCSA class, especially Mr. Mueller. 
It has been a wonderful three years, and I'm sad to see it go. 
Below I have linked my original presentation for my class.
Have a wonderful day, and rest of your life, thank you for reading.

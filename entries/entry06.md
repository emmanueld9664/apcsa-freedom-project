# Entry 6: The Aftermath
##### 5/31/2023

It has been an entire school year now, since October, that I have been working on my Freedom Project. Which I have only recently called Z-Game, and the process has been incredibly unique. 
The course of developing this project has been one that has taught me a lot about game development going forward. 
Not only was development an experience, but so was presenting and showcasing my product to others as well. 
For this Blog Entry, I would be very interested in showing you the takeaways from both events, which have been instrumental in shaping my process of work going forward.
